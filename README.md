React-as3
=========

React is a low-level library that provides [signal/slot] and [functional
reactive programming]-like primitives. It can serve as the basis for a user
interface toolkit, or any other library that has a model on which clients will
listen and to which they will react.

React-as3 is a port of [React](http://github.com/threerings/react), a Java
library created by Three Rings Design.

Building
--------

The library is built using [Ant] (or with and IDE like [Flash Builder]).

From the command line, invoke `ant` to build the library, or `ant maven-deploy`
to build and deploy it to your local Maven repository.

There's also a Flash Builder project at the root level of the repository.
